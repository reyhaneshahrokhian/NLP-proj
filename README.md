## Overview
My idea for the project of this course is to compare Persian tweets of March and April(the
months of our new year) of different years. Since recently the mood of people near new
year was not the same as in previous years, I was encouraged to check the tweets to find
out the effect of the events and people's mood on the tweets.

## Goals
1. Checking the positivity or negativity of tweets using sentiment analysis and
therefore finding out the general mood of people.
2. Finding out the trend subjects of each time.
3. Recognizing the year of tweets.
4. Training a language model that can tweet in 2023 style.
-The focus of this project is on Persian tweets, so the language model is trained on
conversational Persian language.
